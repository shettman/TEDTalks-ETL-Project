The world of TED was founded in 1984 by Richard Saulman as a non profit organisation that aimed at bringing experts from the fields of Technology, Entertainment and Design together, TED Conferences have gone on to become the Mecca of ideas from virtually all walks of life.

Ted, which operates under the slogan 'Ideas worth spreading' has managed to achieve an incredible feat of bringing world renowned experts from various walks of life and study and giving them a platform to distill years of their work and research into talks.

We get to learn an incredible amount, about fields that we are completely alien to, in the form of poignant stories, breathtaking visuals and subtle humor. So in this project, we attempted finding insights about the world of TED, the speakers, their viewers and the ratings.
